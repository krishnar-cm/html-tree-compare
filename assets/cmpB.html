<p><bold>1. During the few years following the remarkable political transition in 2016&#x2013;17 and prior to the onset of the pandemic, The Gambia had shown strong macroeconomic performance</bold> (Annex I, <xref id="RA001tab07" ref-type="table" rid="A001tab07">Table 1</xref>, and <xref id="RA001fig01" ref-type="fig" rid="A001fig01">Text Figure 1</xref>).<xref id="RA001fn01" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn01"><sup>1</sup></xref> Economic growth accelerated from 2 percent in 2016 to 6 percent in 2019, which helped improve some key socio-economic indicators.<xref id="RA001fn02" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn02"><sup>2</sup></xref> Foreign exchange coverage soared from about one month of imports to 4 months of imports during this period, buoyed by large private remittances and disbursements from development partners. Debt sustainability improved as the fiscal deficit narrowed by about 7 percentage points of GDP during this period and most creditors agreed to some debt deferrals. Inflation remained broadly stable.</p>
<p><bold>2. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted some of the hard-won progress</bold> (Annex II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="A001fig01">Text Figure 1</xref>). While the authorities have strived to maintain strong policies and macroeconomic stability, the pandemic has interrupted the growth momentum and progress in some key socio-economic areas. Tourist arrivals plummeted by 62 percent (from 235,788 in 2019 to 89,232 in 2020) and, despite some offsetting expansion in agriculture and industry, economic activity contracted by 0.2 percent in 2020. The pandemic caused budgetary spending of about 3.6 percent of GDP to address its socio-economic impact. Credit to the private sector nearly stagnated.</p>
<p><bold>3. The pandemic has heightened socio-economic fragility</bold>.<xref id="RA001fn03" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn03"><sup>3</sup></xref> The pandemic led to partial loss of income for 48 percent of businesses, scaling down of operations for 43 percent, and shutdown of operations for 19 percent.<xref id="RA001fn04" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn04"><sup>4</sup></xref> Despite the government and development partners&#x2019; relief programs, at least 9 out 10 people reported a decrease in income during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic (March-August 2020).<xref id="RA001fn05" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn05"><sup>5</sup></xref> Rural populations, who mainly depend on agriculture, mostly lost market access due to border closures and the initial ban on local weekly markets (<italic>Lumos</italic>). Consequently, an additional 25,000 people (about 1 percent of the population) were pushed into extreme poverty.<xref id="RA001fn06" ref-type="fn" rid="A001fn06"><sup>6</sup></xref> Furthermore, the pandemic may cause long-term scars. For instance, the schools closure disrupted the education of most children across the country, especially the poor with very <target id="page_6" target-type="page">6</target>limited learning opportunities due to the shift to distance learning that was impossible to implement for most schools. Maternal mortality also worsened.</p>
<p><bold>4. Preparations for a new electoral cycle are underway</bold>. Presidential elections are planned for December 2021, and parliamentary elections for April 2022. The number of voters who have registered for those elections exceeded, by about 10 percent, the registered voters in the 2016 elections. Eighteen political parties are registered for the elections. Representatives of political parties in the Inter-Party Committee expressed support for the continuation of reforms under the ECF-supported program after the elections. Development partners and the civil society are promoting inter-party dialogue.</p>
